The mathematical content is correct: if a is real and b,c are complex conjugates p±qi, then (a-b)(a-c) = [(a-p)²+q²] which is real and positive. The notation could be clearer but does not constitute an error in the argument."

Part (i) properly analyzes the discriminant using properties of complex conjugates for real coefficient polynomials. Part (ii) correctly applies Vieta's formulas. Parts (iii) and (iv) systematically compute power sums and establish the recurrence relation. Part (v) correctly identifies the Vandermonde determinant structure, computes A^T A with entries S_(i+j-2), and performs the critical determinant calculation to derive Δ = -4m³ - 27n². The main weakness is reliance on several standard results (Vieta's formulas, Vandermonde determinant formula) that are not explicitly in the provided KB, though these are foundational undergraduate results. The arithmetic in the final determinant expansion has been verified and is correct. Minor notational ambiguity in part (i) does not affect the validity of the argument."
