Expanding χ₄: (-1-λ)(3-λ)(4-λ) = -(1+λ)(-(λ-3))(-(λ-4)) = -(1+λ)(λ-3)(λ-4), which is identical to χ₁. Both matrices have eigenvalues {-1, 3, 4}, all with multiplicity 1. Since both have distinct eigenvalues, both are diagonalizable. Two diagonalizable matrices with the same eigenvalues and multiplicities are similar.

    "summary": "The solution correctly computes the characteristic polynomial of each matrix using appropriate cofactor expansion techniques. The factorizations are accurate, and the diagonalizability analysis for A₂ and A₃ is correct (they have the same characteristic polynomial but A₃ is not diagonalizable, so they are not similar). However, the solution contains a critical error: it fails to recognize that A₁ and A₄ have identical characteristic polynomials χ₁(λ) = χ₄(λ) = -(λ+1)(λ-3)(λ-4). Both matrices have distinct eigenvalues {-1, 3, 4} and are therefore diagonalizable. Since two diagonalizable matrices are similar if and only if they have the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities, A₁ and A₄ ARE similar. The correct answer is: A₁ and A₄ are similar; A₂ and A₃ are not similar despite having the same characteristic polynomial. This is a significant conceptual error that undermines the entire conclusion."
