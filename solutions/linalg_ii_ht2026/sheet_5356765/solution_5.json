Part (ii): Expand (z-a)(z-b)(z-c) = z³-(a+b+c)z²+(ab+bc+ca)z-abc; matching with z³+mz+n gives coefficient of z² is 0, so a+b+c=0; also ab+bc+ca=m and abc=-n.

      "solution": "**Part (i):** The discriminant Δ=(a-b)²(a-c)²(b-c)² is a product of squared terms, hence non-negative if all factors are real. However, for a cubic with real coefficients m and n, if complex roots exist, they must appear as conjugate pairs. Since we have three roots, either all three are real, or one is real and two are complex conjugates.\n\nIf all roots are real, then all differences (a-b), (a-c), (b-c) are real, so Δ is real and non-negative. If a is real and b, c are complex conjugates, write b=p+qi and c=p-qi with q≠0. Then b-c=2qi, so |b-c|²=4q². Also, a-b and a-c are conjugates, so (a-b)(a-c) = |a-b|². Therefore Δ = |a-b|⁴·|a-c|⁴·(4q²)² is real. Moreover, we can verify by expanding that Δ is actually a symmetric polynomial in the roots with real coefficients, hence must be real.\n\n**Sign interpretation:**\n- Δ > 0: All three roots are real and distinct (all pairwise differences nonzero)\n- Δ = 0: At least two roots coincide (repeated root)\n- Δ < 0: One real root and two complex conjugate roots (the product involves conjugate differences)\n\n**Part (ii):** Expand the left side of (z-a)(z-b)(z-c):\n\n(z-a)(z-b)(z-c) = z³ - (a+b+c)z² + (ab+bc+ca)z - abc\n\nComparing with z³+mz+n (noting there is no z² term), we get:\n- Coefficient of z²: -(a+b+c) = 0, therefore **a+b+c = 0**\n- Coefficient of z: ab+bc+ca = m, therefore **m = ab+bc+ca**\n- Constant term: -abc = n, therefore **n = -abc**\n\n**Part (iii):** \n- S₀ = a⁰+b⁰+c⁰ = 1+1+1 = **3**\n- S₁ = a+b+c = **0** (from part ii)\n- S₂ = a²+b²+c²\n\nTo find S₂, use the identity (a+b+c)² = a²+b²+c² + 2(ab+bc+ca):\n\n0 = S₂ + 2m\n\nTherefore **S₂ = -2m**.\n\n**Part (iv):** Each root satisfies the cubic equation. Specifically, for each root r ∈ {a,b,c}:\n\nr³ + mr + n = 0\n\nMultiplying by rᵏ:\n\nrᵏ⁺³ + mrᵏ⁺¹ + nrᵏ = 0\n\nSumming over all three roots:\n\naᵏ⁺³ + bᵏ⁺³ + cᵏ⁺³ + m(aᵏ⁺¹ + bᵏ⁺¹ + cᵏ⁺¹) + n(aᵏ + bᵏ + cᵏ) = 0\n\nTherefore **Sₖ₊₃ + mSₖ₊₁ + nSₖ = 0** for all k≥0.\n\nApplying this recurrence:\n\nFor k=0: S₃ + mS₁ + nS₀ = 0\nS₃ + m(0) + n(3) = 0\n**S₃ = -3n**\n\nFor k=1: S₄ + mS₂ + nS₁ = 0\nS₄ + m(-2m) + n(0) = 0\n**S₄ = 2m²**\n\n**Part (v):** The matrix A is a Vandermonde matrix:\n\nA = [[1, a, a²],\n     [1, b, b²],\n     [1, c, c²]]\n\nThe determinant of a Vandermonde matrix with rows corresponding to values a, b, c is:\n\n**det A = (b-a)(c-a)(c-b)**\n\nNote that det A = -(a-b)(c-a)(c-b) = (a-b)(a-c)(c-b) = (a-b)(c-a)(c-b) up to sign. More carefully:\n\ndet A = (b-a)(c-a)(c-b)\n\nNow compute A^T A. The (i,j)-entry of A^T A is the dot product of the i-th column of A^T (which is the i-th row of A) with the j-th column of A^T (which is the j-th row of A).\n\nActually, the (i,j)-entry of A^T A equals the sum: 1·1·a^(i-1)·b^(j-1) terms. Let me be more careful.\n\nThe i-th row of A^T is the i-th column of A: [1, 1, 1] for i=1, [a, b, c] for i=2, [a², b², c²] for i=3.\nThe j-th column of A^T is the j-th row of A^T, which is the j-th column of A.\n\nSo (A^T A)ᵢⱼ = (row i of A^T)·(column j of A^T) = (column i of A)·(row j of A).\n\nColumn i of A (for i=1,2,3) is [1, 1, 1]^T, [a, b, c]^T, [a², b², c²]^T.\nRow j of A (for j=1,2,3) is [1, a, a²], [1, b, b²], [1, c, c²].\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let me compute directly.\n\n(A^T A)ᵢⱼ = Σₖ (A^T)ᵢₖ(A)ₖⱼ = Σₖ Aₖᵢ Aₖⱼ\n\nFor row k=1,2,3 and columns i,j:\nRow 1 of A: [1, a, a²]\nRow 2 of A: [1, b, b²]\nRow 3 of A: [1, c, c²]\n\nSo (A^T A)ᵢⱼ = 1^(i-1)·1^(j-1) + a^(i-1)·a^(j-1) + b^(i-1)·b^(j-1) + c^(i-1)·c^(j-1) where we index from 1.\n\nWait, let me index columns of A as 1,2,3 corresponding to powers 0,1,2.\n\n(A^T A)ᵢⱼ = Σₖ=1,2,3 [rₖ^(i-1)][rₖ^(j-1)] where r₁=1, r₂=1, r₃=1 for column 1... No, this is wrong.\n\nLet me restart. A has entry Aᵢⱼ where i indexes rows (corresponding to roots) and j indexes columns (corresponding to powers).\n\nA₁₁=1, A₁₂=a, A₁₃=a²\nA₂₁=1, A₂₂=b, A₂₃=b²\nA₃₁=1, A₃₂=c, A₃₃=c²\n\nSo Aᵢⱼ = rᵢ^(j-1) where r₁=a, r₂=b, r₃=c.\n\n(A^T A)ₘₙ = Σᵢ Aᵢₘ Aᵢₙ = Σᵢ rᵢ^(m-1) rᵢ^(n-1) = Σᵢ rᵢ^(m+n-2) = Sₘ₊ₙ₋₂\n\nTherefore:\n\nA^T A = [[S₀, S₁, S₂],\n         [S₁, S₂, S₃],\n         [S₂, S₃, S₄]]\n       = [[3, 0, -2m],\n          [0, -2m, -3n],\n          [-2m, -3n, 2m²]]\n\nNow det(A^T A) = det(A^T)det(A) = (det A)².\n\nAlso, (det A)² = [(b-a)(c-a)(c-b)]² = (b-a)²(c-a)²(c-b)² = (a-b)²(a-c)²(b-c)² = Δ.\n\nSo we need to compute det(A^T A) and set it equal to Δ.\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n\ndet(A^T A) = 3·det[[-2m, -3n], [-3n, 2m²]] - 0 + (-2m)·det[[0, -3n], [-2m, 2m²]]\n\n= 3[(-2m)(2m²) - (-3n)(-3n)] + (-2m)[0·2m² - (-3n)(-2m)]\n= 3[-4m³ - 9n²] + (-2m)[-6mn]\n= -12m³ - 27n² + 12m²n\n\nHmm, this doesn't immediately give -4m³-27n². Let me recalculate.\n\ndet[[3, 0, -2m],\n    [0, -2m, -3n],\n    [-2m, -3n, 2m²]]\n\nExpanding along the first row:\n= 3·det[[-2m, -3n], [-3n, 2m²]] - 0·(...) + (-2m)·det[[0, -2m], [-2m, -3n]]\n\n= 3·[(-2m)(2m²) - (-3n)(-3n)] + (-2m)·[0·(-3n) - (-2m)(-2m)]\n= 3·[-4m³ - 9n²] + (-2m)·[0 - 4m²]\n= -12m³ - 27n² + (-2m)(-4m²)\n= -12m³ - 27n² + 8m³\n= -4m³ - 27n²\n\nTherefore **Δ = -4m³ - 27n²**.",
